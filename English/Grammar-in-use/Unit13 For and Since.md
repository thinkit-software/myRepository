# For and since

## We use for and since to say how long something has been happening

- for + a period of time `for 다음에는 기간`
  - Sally has been working here for **six months**.
  - I haven't seen Tom for **three days**.

  ```

  20 minutes
  five days

  six months
  50 years
  a week
  ages
  years
  ```
- since + the start of a period `since 다음에는 기간의 시작`
  - Sally has been working here since **April**.
  - I haven't seen Tom since **Monday**.

  ```

  ```
- It is possible to leave out for (but not usually in negative sentences): `for를 생략하는 것은 가능하다 (그러나 부정문에서는 생략하지 않는다)`
  - They've been married (for) ten years. (with or without for)
  - They haven't had a holiday for ten years. (you must use for)
- We do not use for + all ... (all day / all my life etc): `all과 for는 함께 사용하지 않는다.`
  - I've lived there **all my life**. (not for all my life)
- You can use in instead of for in negative sentences (I haven't ... etc): `부정문에서는 for 대신 in을 사용할 수 있다`
  - They haven't had a holiday **in ten years**.

## Compare When ... ? (+ past simple) and how long ... ? (+present perfect)

## We say

### It's (=It is) a long time since something happened

### It's been (=It has been) six months (etc.) since something happened

`어떤 일이 발생한지 기간이 어느정도 지났다는 it is 기간 또는 it has been 기간을 써서 나타낸다`
